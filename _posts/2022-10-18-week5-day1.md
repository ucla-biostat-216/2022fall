## Today

* row rank = column rank.

* Questions:  

  - Q5 on the hw4. Part 2: Show that $\text{dim}(S_1 + S_2) \le \text{dim}(S_1) + \text{dim}(S_2)$. (Hint: show that basis vectors of $S_1$ together with basis vectors of $S_2$ span $S_1 + S_2$). Part 3: Show that $C(A+B) \subseteq C(A) + C(B)$.
  
  - Show how to prove column space and row space are vector spaces
  
  - Go over one example of QR factorization

  - Union of two subspaces $S_1 \cup S_2$ vs summing two subspaces together $S_1 + S_2$
  
  - Derivation of reflection of a matrix
  
  - A line/plane not passing 0, is it a vector space?
  
  - Review how to derive/prove Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

* Matrix inverse and linear equations (cont'd)
