* Teaching evaluation (if you haven't done so). <https://my.ucla.edu/>

* Homework feedback

  - HW6: Q7(2): all solutions can be characterized as ``a particular solution + any vectors in the null space". Q7(3): exclude the possibility of zero solution; we don't have the essential disjointness of column space and null space, unless it's a symmetric matrix; if there's a non-zero solution, then $u$ is in the column space and thus a linear combination of $v$ and $w$, conflicting with the linear independence.
  
  - HW6 Q8: $A$ may not be a square matrix. Need to show $Ax \ne 0$ for any $x \ne 0$.
  
  - HW6 Q10: need to show that the Rayleigh quotient achieves the maximal value.
  
  - HW7 Q1. 
  
  - HW7 Q2.3 orthogonal projector.
  
  - HW7 Q3.

* FAQs

  - HW8 Q2.

  - HW8 Q1: How to use Cholesky factor to check optimality of sigma/covariance matrix
  
  - HW8 Q4.2: how to use the SVD of $\tilde{Y}^T \tilde{X}$?

  - HW8 Q6.1 part 3 and 4 (can you also redo part 1 and 2 also?)
  
* Tips for surviving graduate coursework

  - Start hw early. Time your work. 
  
  - Use every office hour. 
  
  - Ask questions in class and in office hours. 
  
  - Learn to typeset math (Quardro, RMarkdown, Jupyter Notebook, LaTeX). Treat homework as writing exercises.
