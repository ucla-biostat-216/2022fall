## Announcements

* Midterm on Oct 20. In class, closed-book, one page (double-sided, letter size) cheat sheet allowed. It covers the material up to (including) the Rank lecture and homework 1-4.

* If you have any questions regarding lecture notes or homework problems, please let me know by email or Slack. Next Tuesday's lecture (Oct 18) will be a review session IF I receive sufficiently many questions.
